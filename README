Use this script to kill off all running Passenger instances on an Ensim server.

This is useful if you find that a standard Passenger restart is leaving old instances lying around.

Example usage:
  passengerkiller domain

When using Rails 3, you will likely need to specify "-f rack":
  passengerkiller appname -f rack
